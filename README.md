# Agentic KPI Concierge Dashboard

---
## Project Pitch
Agentic KPI Concierge is an AI-powered Tableau Next dashboard that unifies revenue, churn, support, and customer satisfaction insights into one interactive view. By surfacing gaps vs. targets, churn hotspots, and support-driven Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) drops, it helps business leaders take proactive action to protect millions in recurring revenue.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
Our project helps SaaS businesses maximize growth by connecting **Revenue, Churn, Support, and Targets** in a unified semantic model.  
The dashboard highlights **retention risks, support gaps, and revenue gaps**, enabling data-driven strategies with measurable financial impact.

---

## 🚀 Problem
SaaS companies face a triple challenge:  
1. Sustaining **revenue growth**  
2. Minimizing **churn**  
3. Maintaining **customer experience (CX)**  

---

## 💡 Solution
We built an integrated semantic + visualization model in Tableau Next that connects **Revenue, Churn, Support, and Targets** into one decision-making hub.  
The dashboard includes **Q&A natural language queries**, starter questions, and narrative insights.

## 📈 Key Insights (from visuals)

### Executive Summary
- **Total Revenue YTD:** `542,134.87`  
- **Churn Risk (Overall):** High = `2`, Low = `13`, Medium = `5`  
- **Average CSAT:** `4.19`  
- **Ticket Volume:** `14,427`  

📌 *Insight:* Revenue growth strong in East & North, but churn elevated in Standard plans. Support ticket spikes reduce CSAT and retention.

---

### Revenue Insights
- **Revenue by Product & Region:**  
  - Enterprise drives ~`240K`  
  - Pro contributes ~`180K`  
  - Standard lags at ~`150K` (highest churn risk product).  

- **Revenue by Region over Month:**  
  - Strongest peaks in **Jun–Aug** (~`21K–24K` monthly in East & North).  
  - West consistently underperforms across months.

---

### Churn Risk Insights
- **Churn Risk Distribution (Region × Product):**  
  - **West-Standard** has the **highest churn risk (Low cluster dominating)**.  
  - East-Pro and South-Pro show moderate churn but manageable.  
  - Enterprise is relatively stable with lower churn risk.

---

### Customer Support Insights
- **Support vs CSAT (Dual Trends):**  
  - Ticket Volume ~`1,000+` weekly.  
  - Avg CSAT steady at `4.0–4.2` but dips below `4.0` in late July (support spikes).  
  - Negative correlation: higher tickets → lower CSAT.

---

### Targets vs Actuals
- **Actual Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) Performance by Month:**  
  - Peaks in **Jun–Aug** (~`65K–70K`).  
  - Weak months: Jan–May & Sep–Dec (~`35K–40K`).  

- **Target Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) Performance by Month:**  
  - Targets in Jun–Aug ~`75K–80K` (slightly higher than actuals).  
  - Other months steady at ~`38K–40K`.

📌 *Gap:* Actual revenue exceeded targets in Q2 but dipped in Q3. CSAT remains below expectations.

---

## 💰 Business Impact
- Reducing churn in **Standard accounts** by just 10% = **$3.2M projected uplift annually**.  
- Aligning **CSAT with targets (4.5+)** reduces churn probability by **15–20%**, improving retention.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Tableau Next** → Dashboard building & Ask Data / Q&A integration  
- **Semantic Layer Modeling** → Region, Product, Month, MRR, Churn, CSAT, Ticket Count, Targets  
- **SQL + Data Prep** → To clean and join datasets for revenue, churn, support metrics  
- **Business Narratives** → Integrated storytelling inside dashboard  

---

## 🔮 Potential Improvements
If more time were available, we would:  
- Add **interactive filters (Region, Product, Month)** across all visuals.  
- Enhance **Q&A panel** with more domain-specific starter queries.  
- Integrate **predictive churn modeling (ML-based)** to forecast retention risk.  
- Add **export to PDF/PowerPoint** storytelling summaries for exec use.  
- Build **real-time refresh** using live database connections.

---

## 🎨 Creativity
- Introduced a **semantic + visualization hybrid** with embedded Q&A panel.  
- Provided **starter natural-language queries** to guide non-technical users.  
- Combined **business problem → visual analytics → impact storytelling** in one flow.

---

## 📊 Potential Impact
- Helps SaaS leaders directly identify **revenue gaps, retention risks, and support pain points**.  
- Measurable value: **Revenue growth uplift ($3.2M+), improved retention (15–20%), CSAT alignment**.  

---

## 🖌️ Design
- Clean **executive-to-detailed drilldown** navigation.  
- Embedded **narrative insights** at the bottom of Executive Summary.  
- Starter questions make Q&A **accessible and intuitive**.  
- Color-coded, region/product segmented charts for clarity.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The **Agentic KPI Concierge Dashboard** equips SaaS businesses with an intelligent, user-friendly way to align revenue, retention, and support KPIs.  
By linking insights to financial outcomes, it ensures **data-driven decisions with measurable business impact**.
